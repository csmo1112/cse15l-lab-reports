## Part 1: Bugs  
Failure-inducing input:  
In `ArrayTests.java`, we have the test of a simple array, `{1, 2, 3}`:  
```
@Test
public void testReversed2() {
  int[] input1 = {1,2,3};
  assertArrayEquals(new int[]{3,2,1}, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
}
```
An input that does not cause a failure is when an array's reverse is the same as the original, for example `{}`:
```
  @Test
  public void testReversed() {
    int[] input1 = { };
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ }, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
```  
The symptom when running in the terminal:
```

FAILURES!!!

```
In `ArrayExamples.java`, we keep the original code to replicate the bug:  
```
  // Returns a *new* array with all the elements of the input array in reversed
  // order
  static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return arr;
  }
```
And we fixed the bug and the new, working code is shown below:
```
  static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      newArray[arr.length - i - 1] = arr[i];
    }
    return newArray;
  }
```  
By making the function return `newArray` instead of `arr` (the original array), and switching the order of assignment, we fix the bugs in the function `reversed()`. Previously, the function copied empty array values from `newArray` into the original array instead of copying original values into the new one, resulting in the fuction returning an empty array. After the fixes, the symptoms are addressed as well:

## Part 2: Researching Commands  

`grep` has many command-line options, and the four that I chose are `-r`, `-c`, `-w`, and `-v`. Generally, `grep` looks for patterns within . I found these while looking at the [Linux Manual Page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html), and the examples on `./technical` are shown below:  

`-r` recursively searches the specified directory and its contents, and returns the line containing the match. The first test I did was calling `grep -r "Monday" .`, and my results are shown here:  
```

```  
Since my working directory was `/c/Users/chris/Documents/GitHub/docsearch/technical`, it recursively searched all directories within `technical` and outputted the line that had "Monday" in it. I then tested `grep -r "Monday" ./911report/` and as expected, got the top two matches from the above output: 
```
chris@LAPTOP-HS27MT5I MINGW64 ~/Documents/GitHub/docsearch/technical (main)
$ grep -r "Monday" ./911report/

```
